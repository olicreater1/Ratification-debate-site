            <h1>John Francis Mercer</h1>
            <h3>Anti-Federalist</h3>

            <h2>Background</h2>
            <br></br>
            <p>
                Born in 1759 on a plantation in the colony of Virginia, John Mercer was one of 18 children across his father's two wives. His father was a wealthy lawyer.
                Mercer served as a soldier in the Revolution, where he was injured at the Battle of Brandywine, eventually resigning in July 1779.
                In 1782, Mercer was elected to be one of two representatives, alongside Charles Carter, for Stafford County, where Mercer lived in Virginia.
                Mercer was chosen by his fellow representatives to be one of their delegates to the Continental Congress. When his fellow delegate from Stafford County died,
                a special election was held, and Mercer was selected to fill that place for the rest of the session. He then went on to marry his wife, Sophia Spriggs,
                in 1785, and they moved to Anne Arundel County to operate West River Farmâ€”a slave-powered plantation that his wife inherited from her grandparents. At the same time,
                Mercer became the Maryland representative to the Philadelphia Convention in 1787 but withdrew before signing the Constitution because he was opposed to centralization.
                Mercer was a delegate for Maryland on and off for several years before eventually becoming the 10th governor of Maryland from 1801 to 1803. Mercer died after seeking
                medical help in Philadelphia on August 30, 1821.

            <p>
                We the people, for the people must not be blinded by the power of a central government. The states MUST have a large part in the government of this country. 
                If not, the county will fall into misrepresented chayos. If the person in charge is given no checks, they will make foolish decisions on a whim that cannot be reviewed or challenged. 
                Congress is also problematic in its bias towards the majority. There are many less in congress than live in the country, so therefore congress votes on the interest of the few and not the many. 
                If larger states are given more representation, the minority will always be outvoted. These problems will be very large and evident 
                with a central government that would not occur if the power is held in the states. The state decisions will be made to help the people that live in the state, not for one individual in Washington. 
                Think of the local farmers. They way need a law passed that helps them to produce food but if passing that law requires their issue to be resolved in the captiol of the country it will never get passed. 
                This is solved in a decentralized government by the fact that the farmers' needed law can be brought to their state lawmaker and quickly and easily passed. In a decentralized governemnt, the many have the power. 
                The minority gets a vote. The decisions must be benifit all or they will not occur. This makes a decentralized government the obvious structure to govern with because of how well it helps the people.

            <h2>Rebuttals</h2>
            <p>1. The government will make all the decisions in their interest and not in the interest of the people because one person will make all the decisions and that one person cannot possibly know every single little problem of a local farmer. This simply does not occur in a decentrlized government because a farmer can bring up an issue and have it solved by his states own capitol.</p>
            <p>2. The interest of the majority of people will always overrule the interest of the minority. This occurs because the larger states are easier to please and more important in an election to please because they have more voters. When this occurs, small states will never get their way and it won't matter because their voting power is lesser. This issue is solved by decentralized government</p>
            <p>3. The system without checks and ballances can do whatever it wants very quickly, which is dangerous because of the lack of review of policy. If the president wants to war with someone, they can. To stop this we must make the states all agree to be able to make war and other issues that effect the entire country.</p>
